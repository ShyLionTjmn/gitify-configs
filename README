This script will scan directories for device configs and MOVE them to archive, leaving latest in archive root.
Archive is a git repository, keeping track of all config changes.

Script will scan config files for "hostname blah-blah" string and "/system identity\nset name=blah-blah" for hostanme and create <hostname>.config file.
Because of that, hostnames MUST be unique across devices.


Git repository dir must be initialized with "git init" before first use.
Also add some file like README to start HEAD: echo "something" > README && git add README && git commit -m "initializing" README

How to use archive:

  git log -p <hostname>.config
     To show change log of device

  git show HEAD@{2023-08-10}:./<hostname>.config
     To see version as of day
