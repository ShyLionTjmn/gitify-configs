This script will scan directories for device configs and MOVE them to archive, leaving latest in archive root.
Archive is a git repository, keeping track of all config changes.

Script will scan config files for "hostname blah-blah" string and "/system identity\nset name=blah-blah" for hostanme and create <hostname>.config file.
Because of that, hostnames MUST be unique across devices.

Git repository dir must be initialized with "git init" before first use.
